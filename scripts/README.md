# Scripts

These scripts can be used to demonstrate data egress.

## Egress Scripts

Two scripts, one for Windows (egress.ps1) and one for Linux (egress.sh)

## Convertion Script

Following an egress, export all the queries into a CSV file and run that file through the right `convert` script.
